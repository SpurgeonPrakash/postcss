PostCSS is a CSS post-processor engine that allows you to transform regular CSS through JavaScript plugins. Like LESS, Sass, and Stylus, these plugins allow you to use CSS in new and exciting ways like automatically prefixing your CSS for older browsers; adding variables, conditionals, or nesting; and even transpiling next-generation CSS so that it works in older browsers today. PostCSS can be 3â€“30 times faster than other pre-processors and offers a modular approach, so you can install just the plugins you want to use.

In this short course, you'll learn how to set up a workflow for Gulp.jsusing PostCSS, which can speed up the way you build websites and change the way you write CSS. Author Ray Villalobos will also introduce the most useful PostCSS plugins, including cssnano, Autoprefixer, cssnext, and PreCSS.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
